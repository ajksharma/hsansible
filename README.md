The Hsansible Package
=====================

[Ansible](http://ansible.cc) is a software for deploying, managing, and
orchestrating computer systems over SSH. It has a modular design that allows
users to create modules for various parts of the system.

This package provides simple framework for rapid development of
[Ansible](http://ansible.cc) modules in [Haskell](http://haskell.org)
programming language. Haskell is flexible when it comes to being compiled or
interpreted and so it's possible to use it either way, but each has it's own
trade-offs.
