SOURCE_DIR
  Directory where Markdown sources, that ends with \`.[1-8].md', are stored.

TARGET_DIR
  This is where the output will be stored, but it has to be noted that
  directory structure in form man/man[1-8] will be created to store the
  generated manual pages. Directory "\$TARGET_DIR/man" can be used as a value
  in MANPATH environment variable. If not specified then current directory is
  used.

ERROR: Command \`pandoc' wasn't found.

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install package named \`pandoc', but generally it is
possible to install it via \`cabal-install':

    cabal install pandoc

Then you have to ensure that bin directory where Cabal puts executables is in
your PATH, or use \`--symlink-bindir=\$HOME/bin' or different directory that is
in your PATH.
